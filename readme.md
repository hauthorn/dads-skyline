# Assignment 1 of "Algorithms & Data Structures 2"
Created as a part of the assignment, as I wanted to visualize the algorithm I designed.

Given a list with elements {x,h,y}, the algorithm constructs a _skyline_, which is a list of coordinates.
Time complexity is O(n log(n)) as required.

The javascript isn't as elegant as I would like. I might do a cleanup at some later point.
